class_name Types

# Place custom types, like enums or classes, here! This allows you to just say Types.EnvironmentType far more easily 
# than if you have to search around for what file you stored an enum in. Note this is *not* a global singleton, just 
# an explicit type definition that the global class manager can recognize and use to scope the types.

# Hold onto game state; this can be loaded with SaverLoader, and can be manipulated
# as if it has any property you want to use. You can just call GSM.Thing1 = "blah", and you can
# then use GSM.Thing1 later. You don't have to declare Thing1 on this class for that to function.

# Note that the getter will actually throw an error, intentionally, if the property does not 
# exist when you go to get it.

# Thanks to @assertchris on Mastodon for implementing the setter method, and simplifying the getter.
